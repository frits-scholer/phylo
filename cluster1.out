GLPK Integer Optimizer, v4.57
10 rows, 10 columns, 46 non-zeros
10 integer variables, all of which are binary
Preprocessing...
8 rows, 9 columns, 44 non-zeros
9 integer variables, all of which are binary
Scaling...
 A: min|aij| =  1.000e+00  max|aij| =  1.000e+00  ratio =  1.000e+00
Problem data seem to be well scaled
Constructing initial basis...
Size of triangular part is 8
