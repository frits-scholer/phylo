Attached is an example of a multi-run with different parameters input that Edy is using right now. 
Line 1: Input tree 
Line 2: y/n to collapse zero branch length nodes 
Line 3 onwards: parameters separated by commas - min cluster size,fdr cut-off,gamma. Each parameter set is separated by a newline. 

For the reordered newick tree and final output nexus tree output, we can have an appended name with parameter information such as: 
reordered_example.nwk 
phyclip_cs3_fdr0.2_gam1.0_example.tre

The output statistics we need to calculate for each parameter includes: 
1) Number of sequences clustered by solver 
2) % of total sequences clustered 
3) Number of clusters selected by solver. 
4) Mean of mean pairwise distances of clusters selected.
5) Standard deviation of mean pairwise distances of clusters selected.  
6) Mean of the median pairwise distances of clusters selected. 
7) Standard deviation of the median pairwise distances of clusters selected.
8) Mean of the inter-cluster distances between clusters selected. 
9) Standard deviation of inter-cluster distances between clusters selected. 
10) Median of inter-cluster distances between clusters selected.
11) Median absolute deviation (MAD) of inter-cluster distances between clusters selected.
