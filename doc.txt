ยง1 Introduction

preliminary program interleaf.cpp

[Set up tree]
     	User input: treefile, min nr of leaves and gamma
[Select clades]
	Calc for clades with at least min nr of leaves mean of interleaf distances
[Calc grand median]
	Calc median of these means gm
[Calc mad]
	Calc mad for i such that mu(i) >= gm mad = median(mu(i)-gm)
[Filter]
	keep i with mu(i) <= gm +(gamma*mad)
[Get distributions]
	For all i calc D(i) = {interleaf distances for clade with mu(i)}

ยง2 Set up tree

interleaf_test.cpp is used to develop the data structures
